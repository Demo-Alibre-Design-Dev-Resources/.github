**R&D** | **Work-In-Progress**

Testbed for add-ons, scripting, workflows, techniques, solutions, integrations, templates, examples, and tools.

- For the latest code and updates, contact me. I push to GitHub periodically or as needed.

- You don't need a GitHub account to access content. You can fork repositories or download them as zip files.

- I have tried to cleanup and link to related posts and threads on the forum to make things easy to find.

- I may edit posts to make them more consistent with GitHub and vice versa.

- This project is very early and mostly incomplete.

- The primary goal is to keep API and scripting resources updated and in one place.

- This is an open project, everything will eventually be on GitHub/online.

- Testbed For Alibre Design is a research and development project, not intended to only include finished work.

- Please share your ideas and suggestions.

Branding and related information will change. I will give an update after major changes have been completed. Thanks.
